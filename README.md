# Moovie - Your favorite Movie Finder

Moovie is a personal project application created to practice skills in React.JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS e API REST.

## Overview

Its main purpose is to help users find movies by providing features such as viewing trailers, accessing reviews, and other pertinent information. With this tool, movie enthusiasts can conveniently explore and discover films, making the process of choosing what to watch easier and more enjoyable.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Find movies: Users can search for movies of their interest.

- Watch trailers: The application allows users to view movie trailers to get an idea of what to expect.

- Access reviews: Users can check movie reviews and ratings to help make decisions on what to watch.

- Explore relevant information: The application provides pertinent information about the movies, such as cast, director, synopsis, and more.

- Discover new movies: Users can use the application to discover movies they might not have otherwise known about.

- Ease of choice: The application makes it easier for users to decide what to watch, saving time on research.

### Useful resources

- [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) - This helped me to import movies informations with API REST to create all this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
